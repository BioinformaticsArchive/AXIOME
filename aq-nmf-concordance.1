.SH NAME 
aq-nmf-concordance \- Produce a concordance plot for non-negative matrix factorization in R
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aq-nmf-concordance -i otu_table -o output_dir -a
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a concordance plot, \fBnmf-concordance.pdf\fR, for non-negative matrix factorization using R. Non-negative matrix factorization is a technique to reduce high-dimensional data in fewer dimensions by construction bases with non-negative contributions to explain the data. For the complete analysis, 
.BR aq-nmf (1)
requires a degree. To determine the degree, a concordance plot is needed which will show the suitability of a particular degree for the data. The degrees that appear as local maxima in the concordance plot are suitable to try for NMF analysis. That is, any point whose neighbours appear lower on the plot are good candidates for NMF analysis.

Sometimes, the concordance plot will be degenerate, such as a slowly increasing line. If this is the case, the correct NMF degree cannot be reliably determined from the data. Adding more sequences per sample can improve the result.

Supplying the -a flag will do an "automatic" analysis of the concordance plot, and if any local maxima are found, it will call aq-nmf on those degrees.

OTU table must be supplied in tab-delimited format.
