.SH NAME 
aq-mrpp \- Compute Multi Response Permutation Procedure of within- versus among-group dissimilarities in R
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aq-mrpp
.SH DESCRIPTION
Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) provides a test of whether there is a significant difference between two or more groups of sampless. Samples are group based on all provided variables from the \fBmapping.txt\fR file. For each variable, three plots are produced: a multi-dimensional scaling, histogram of the differences among groups, and a graph of mean distances. This is done using the \fBvegan\fR R package. Bray-Curtis distances are used between samples.
