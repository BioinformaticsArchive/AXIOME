{"tagline":"AXIOME - Automation, Extension, and Integration Of Microbial Ecology: Helper tools to make managing numerical ecology pipelines easier","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"AXIOME is a way of automating analyses with the [QIIME](http://qiime.sourceforge.net/) (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) and [mothur](http://mothur.org) toolkits. Given a file of input data and analyses, it generates a Makefile to perform the analyses. It also includes other analyses not found in QIIME or mothur.\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\n\r\nTo build, you will need: GNU autotools, valac, libgee-dev, libmagic-dev, zlib1g-dev, libbz2-dev, libxml2-dev\r\n\r\nTo run, it will need: gawk, make, bzip2, gzip, and R.\r\n\r\nSome features require: pandaseq, blast2, gnuplot\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\nUbuntu users can [download packages](https://launchpad.net/~neufeldlab/+archive/ppa/). These can be installed with: `sudo apt-add-repository ppa:neufeldlab/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install axiome`.\r\n\r\nThe source package can be built with `./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install`.\r\n\r\nAXIOME can be installed on MacOS, but it is somewhat tricky. Install all the packages needed using Fink or MacPorts. You will then have to manually upgrade [GLib](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/) to at least 2.31.0 and [Gee](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libgee/) to 0.6 and install them both on top of the version managed by Fink. [Vala](http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/sources/vala/) is required, but not available in Fink. Install at least version 0.14, but the latest version is recommended.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nAXIOME automates the activity of QIIME using a main tool called axiome and a configuration file. A sample configuration file is included, called sample.ax. Information about how to use the tool and the contents of the configuration file can be found in the manual page, which can be viewed by typing man axiome or using the [Linux GUI help](man:axiome).\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n[GPLv3+](http://gplv3.fsf.org/)\r\n\r\n# Authors\r\n\r\nMichael Hall ([mwhall@uwaterloo.ca](mwhall@uwaterloo.ca))\r\n\r\nMichael Lynch ([mdjlynch@gmail.com](mdjlynch@gmail.com))\r\n\r\nAndre Masella ([andre@masella.name](andre@masella.name))\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nDr. Josh Neufeld ([jneufeld@uwaterloo.ca](jneufeld@uwaterloo.ca))\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n\r\nYou can download this project in either [zip](http://github.com/neufeld/axiome/zipball/master) or [tar](http://github.com/neufeld/axiome/tarball/master) formats.
