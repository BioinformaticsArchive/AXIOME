.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aqxs

.SH DESCRIPTION
Compile a new module for AXIOME. Modules allow new directives to be added to the input files to create new rules. You should only need this if you are attempting to add new analyses. Each new rule requires extending the \fBAXIOME.RuleProcessor\fR or \fBAXIOME.BaseSource\fR classes.

For more information, consult the \fBsample.vala\fR included in the distribution.
