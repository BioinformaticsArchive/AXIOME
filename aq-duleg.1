.SH NAME 
aq-duleg \- Compute Dufrene-Legendre indicator species analysis in R
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aq-duleg [-B] \fBp\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Calculates the indicator value (fidelity and relative abundance) of species in clusters or types. This is done using the \fBlabdsv\fR R package. Bray-Curtis distances are used between samples. Parameter \fBp\fR provides a p-value cutoff for output (must be less than 1). otu_table.txt must exist in the working directory. When called through AutoQIIME, this is done for you. If using QIIME version 1.5.0 or greater, use flag -B to specify that the OTU table is in BIOM format.
