.SH DESCRIPTION
Calculates the indicator value (fidelity and relative abundance) of species in clusters or types. This is done using the \fBlabdsv\fR R package. Bray-Curtis distances are used between samples. Parameter \fBp\fR provides a p-value cutoff for output (must be less than 1). otu_table_ordered_columns.txt must exist in the working directory. When called through AutoQIIME, this is done for you.
