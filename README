AutoQIIME
=========

Tools for making QIIME easier to use.

You'll need to install this package with:
	./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

You will need to install several R packages which are dependencies. This can be done by calling:
	aq-inst-cran

And then you should read sample.aq and man autoqiime

If you would like a printable manual, in this directory run:
	./mkmanual
to generate AutoQIIMEManual.pdf
